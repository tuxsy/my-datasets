848,Clara,"Clara works with some world class enterprise who have asked the question: ""Why do we still use 80's tools to manage and collaborate on complex datasets?""  We agree, knowledge workers need better tools that more accurately represent the worlds complex tangle of relationships. Clara has built a tool which uses Excel as a backend but allows enterprises to give row level edit access and keep certain data private for certain user types. Clara can also hide and show data as needed to make large datasets easier to work with and understand.   Some of our use cases:  1. Consulting - We work with consulting firms who create public ecosystem maps like - Insurtechmap.eu to showcase their thought leadership, gather data on firms (using our platform) and generate leads/sell access to a private version with more insights.  2. Ecosystem Management - We have a payments firm client using it to manage their client ecosystem to understand which clients use which of their products, which merchants are connected (via the same legal entities etc). In some cases it's hard for merchants like Visa to understand one of their key clients subsidiaries is running thousands of very small POS machines and there is value in understanding this and offering better service to a big clients smaller subsidiaries/businesses and merchant networks.  3. Membership Management - Associations and industry bodies that represent a number of members use the tool to manage their members profiles and promote their services. They also use it to connect members with other members where value can be created. The tool is used both publicly to showcase members and their products and services and privately with more data to make connections between members smoother and faster. They also use the tool to show their larger members the value they are receiving being part of the network.  4. Innovation Project Management - We have a client using the tool to manage internal innovation concepts (submission and vetting) and their international innovation portfolio. It's also used to submit new ideas (unfunded) and communication innovation concepts and ideas across the entire organisation.   5. Network Security - understanding the servers and machines connected to them and any threats of holes in the security protocols.  6. Overdraft Management - FS firms can use the tool to see which merchants authorise payments without checking the account has the required funds and incurs a overdraft fee. With this knowledge banks can warn merchants or ban payments.  7. Code Base Management - We're working with a large consultancy firm to map out legacy code bases in an interactive tree view. This allows them to understand what large parts of these old code bases interact with/touch. For example many large banks have legacy software built with COBOL that no newer developers understand. Many are building new core systems around, on top of or adjacent to these older systems. However some of the banks key technology is deeply entrenched in these old systems. Our tool will allow their tech teams to cut away all the stuff they've replaced already (email servers or payment auth) and understand these code bases in much clearer ways whilst also understanding which parts of this codebase touch other parts of the business in ways not possible before.  8. Client and Internal Relationship Management -  use the tool to understand internal and external relationships. For example does the Tax partner know the head of the Canadian Treasury but nobody else has the connection (which is a risk to mitigate) or maybe a key client is only connected with one partner and associate and the firm needs to generate more connections to avoid losing this client, or which client is connected to which entities. It's also intended to be used internally for mapping key stakeholders, relationship managers and gatekeepers and other useful 'people' data.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/bi/clara-profile,,

864,X-Cross,"Almost all CLOUD management software, i.e. running on the Internet, are ""guest"" applications of a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). This operating mode, however, was born to manage simple applications (navigation, internet banking, online shopping) and is absolutely not suitable for use with complex programs such as an ERP.  The improper use of this technology limits - and not a little - productivity and the user experience, due to a necessarily simplified interface, the slowness in loading data, the poor responsiveness to user input. Not to mention that the browser often crashes for no apparent reason.  X-Cross solves this problem once and for all thanks to Total Client technology, which allows the software to work via the web exactly as it does on a local network, without the user noticing any difference, as the performance, in terms of speed and responsiveness, is practically identical.  X-Cross, like other ERPs, is aimed at companies that operate in a wide variety of business fields and have different needs. Even within the same industry, each company may operate in a very different way.  To solve this problem, almost all software companies offer the possibility of making customizations to their programs - in jargon, ""customizations"" - in order to adapt them to the specific needs of their customers. This is a very strong need; it's no coincidence that 87% of the companies we interviewed that were interested in X-Cross consider this aspect to be highly significant in their choice of management software.  This operation, however, is not without its problems. Let's consider them one by one.   The development times of customizations are often very long, with consequent costs, which are not divided, as for standard software updates, among all users, but are entirely borne by the company requesting the customization.  Those who have overcome the first hurdle, and have nevertheless decided to develop a customized version of the software, later realize an even more serious problem. Every update of the standard program to the subsequent versions, in fact, involves considerable charges for the transfer of customizations to the new version. This is because it is almost never applicable tout court to the customized version and therefore, in order to carry out the realignment, other development activities are necessary, with further waiting times and, above all, a substantial increase in costs to be sustained.  The alternative, which many end up adopting, is to remain anchored to the version of the program on which the customization has been developed, renouncing to subsequent updates, but this way of operating is not sustainable indefinitely.  Beyond the problems of security, efficiency and reliability of the system that this short-sighted strategy entails, sooner or later, either because of the release of new operating systems, or because of legal obligations, it will still be necessary to update and incur in one go all the costs necessary to realign the customized software to the latest standard version.  With X-Cross, you no longer have to worry about the time and cost of customizing and updating your ERP. CrossModel, the development tool X-Cross was created with, solves all customization issues at the root.  Thanks to it, X-Cross can, at any time, be updated to the latest version without any cost for the transfer of the changes made, which are automatically transferred to the standard version without any manual intervention.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/erp/x-cross-profile,3.0,1.0

Our History - NEXUSsoft is an Australian owned company located in Brisbane that has been in business since 2003. We started as a single person in our own multifaceted business designing software that met our unique requirements.   The operations of our business spanned entertainment, hospitality, events, and retail sectors.   We gained our first external customer in 2008, that being an IT and telecommunications managed service provider. Our next being a printing company. We gained our next customer in 2011 that operated in the medico-legal assessments industry.   In each case, these businesses had requirements that meant that a templated ERP  system was not going to meet their requirements. Some of them had tried using off the shelf systems and some had not. Some had spent considerable amounts of money implementing ERP systems that were eventually discarded.   From the outset we have been not just a team of software developers, but a team of people determined to make software fit the requirements of a business and not the other way around.   We know that there are innovative businesses being held back by bad systems, manual processes, errors, and rework. We also know that when we find these businesses, we can help them grow, change, adapt and succeed.   We know that we are not for everyone.   We know why ERP deployments suceed and fail, and we have been working with innovative Australian businesses for more than 20 years.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/erp/icerp-by-nexussoft-profile,5.0,4.0
