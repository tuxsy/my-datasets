797,797,Agrello,"Agrello's platform simplifies everything from document management to digital signatures with all the back-and-forth drafting that happens in-between.  When starting and running a business, there is a lot of paperwork that needs to be done. Whether it's the first round of funding, hiring employees, or initial business deals. So instead of complicating things that are already complicated, let us help with the signing and document management process.   Agrello eSignature and document management platform gives you a clear overview of the signing process. From anywhere, with any device.  Agrello's digital signature application is built specifically for SMEs, entrepreneurs and legal advisors to improve the signing process, to make it easier and less time-consuming.   Agrello's strong electronic signature is based on the industry-standard XAdES signature format and ASiC document containers. Even if you download a signed copy in PDF format with your visual signature, the only source of truth is still the XAdES+ASiC combination stored in our service.  This combination means that any digital signature can only be issued if the signer is in direct possession of the signing private key, which is not known to anyone else and cannot be stored anywhere other than on a specific, dedicated physical device under the signer's sole control - a mobile phone, smart card, etc.   In our hectic daily lives, this is a major drawback because it requires users to take more steps to be able to sign than they have patience for.   That's why we decided to introduce a whole new kind of digital signature, still based on the principles of strong digital signatures, but not requiring a special security device. We are introducing a Basic signature that complements our existing Secure signature and makes signing faster and easier.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/digital-signage/id-profile,4.5

A solution that offers customization options allows organizations to tailor the onboarding process to their unique needs and requirements. This can help ensure that the onboarding process is aligned with the organization's goals, values, and culture.  In addition to customizability, a robust set of core capabilities is essential for a successful onboarding solution. These capabilities can include online forms and document management, task management, progress tracking, compliance tracking, and omnichannel communications. Omnichannel communications is a particularly important capability, as it allows organizations to communicate with new hires via a range of channels, including email, SMS, and mobile apps. This can help ensure that new hires stay informed and engaged throughout the onboarding process.  In conclusion, investing in a streamlined and enhanced employee onboarding solution can offer numerous benefits to organizations, including improved efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced compliance, improved productivity, and increased employee engagement. When choosing a solution, it's important to consider both customizability and core capabilities, including omnichannel communications, to ensure a successful and effective onboarding experience.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/hr/optimum-onboarding-profile,
817,817,Visitor Management System 21,"A visitor management system is very important to your business. The front desk, or reception area, can often be one of the busiest places in your business, with staff, visitors, deliveries and contractors coming and going.

The VMS-21 visitor management system takes care of these processes, allowing you to focus on the person and provide a warm welcome. Your visitors simply sign-in on the VMS-21 Tablet, Touch Screen or Kiosk and the VMS-21 System does the rest for you.

848,848,Clara,"Clara works with some world class enterprise who have asked the question: ""Why do we still use 80's tools to manage and collaborate on complex datasets?""  We agree, knowledge workers need better tools that more accurately represent the worlds complex tangle of relationships. Clara has built a tool which uses Excel as a backend but allows enterprises to give row level edit access and keep certain data private for certain user types. Clara can also hide and show data as needed to make large datasets easier to work with and understand.   Some of our use cases:  1. Consulting - We work with consulting firms who create public ecosystem maps like - Insurtechmap.eu to showcase their thought leadership, gather data on firms (using our platform) and generate leads/sell access to a private version with more insights.  2. Ecosystem Management - We have a payments firm client using it to manage their client ecosystem to understand which clients use which of their products, which merchants are connected (via the same legal entities etc). In some cases it's hard for merchants like Visa to understand one of their key clients subsidiaries is running thousands of very small POS machines and there is value in understanding this and offering better service to a big clients smaller subsidiaries/businesses and merchant networks.  3. Membership Management - Associations and industry bodies that represent a number of members use the tool to manage their members profiles and promote their services. They also use it to connect members with other members where value can be created. The tool is used both publicly to showcase members and their products and services and privately with more data to make connections between members smoother and faster. They also use the tool to show their larger members the value they are receiving being part of the network.  4. Innovation Project Management - We have a client using the tool to manage internal innovation concepts (submission and vetting) and their international innovation portfolio. It's also used to submit new ideas (unfunded) and communication innovation concepts and ideas across the entire organisation.   5. Network Security - understanding the servers and machines connected to them and any threats of holes in the security protocols.  6. Overdraft Management - FS firms can use the tool to see which merchants authorise payments without checking the account has the required funds and incurs a overdraft fee. With this knowledge banks can warn merchants or ban payments.  7. Code Base Management - We're working with a large consultancy firm to map out legacy code bases in an interactive tree view. This allows them to understand what large parts of these old code bases interact with/touch. For example many large banks have legacy software built with COBOL that no newer developers understand. Many are building new core systems around, on top of or adjacent to these older systems. However some of the banks key technology is deeply entrenched in these old systems. Our tool will allow their tech teams to cut away all the stuff they've replaced already (email servers or payment auth) and understand these code bases in much clearer ways whilst also understanding which parts of this codebase touch other parts of the business in ways not possible before.  8. Client and Internal Relationship Management -  use the tool to understand internal and external relationships. For example does the Tax partner know the head of the Canadian Treasury but nobody else has the connection (which is a risk to mitigate) or maybe a key client is only connected with one partner and associate and the firm needs to generate more connections to avoid losing this client, or which client is connected to which entities. It's also intended to be used internally for mapping key stakeholders, relationship managers and gatekeepers and other useful 'people' data.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/bi/clara-profile,

864,864,X-Cross,"Almost all CLOUD management software, i.e. running on the Internet, are ""guest"" applications of a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.). This operating mode, however, was born to manage simple applications (navigation, internet banking, online shopping) and is absolutely not suitable for use with complex programs such as an ERP.  The improper use of this technology limits - and not a little - productivity and the user experience, due to a necessarily simplified interface, the slowness in loading data, the poor responsiveness to user input. Not to mention that the browser often crashes for no apparent reason.  X-Cross solves this problem once and for all thanks to Total Client technology, which allows the software to work via the web exactly as it does on a local network, without the user noticing any difference, as the performance, in terms of speed and responsiveness, is practically identical.  X-Cross, like other ERPs, is aimed at companies that operate in a wide variety of business fields and have different needs. Even within the same industry, each company may operate in a very different way.  To solve this problem, almost all software companies offer the possibility of making customizations to their programs - in jargon, ""customizations"" - in order to adapt them to the specific needs of their customers. This is a very strong need; it's no coincidence that 87% of the companies we interviewed that were interested in X-Cross consider this aspect to be highly significant in their choice of management software.  This operation, however, is not without its problems. Let's consider them one by one.   The development times of customizations are often very long, with consequent costs, which are not divided, as for standard software updates, among all users, but are entirely borne by the company requesting the customization.  Those who have overcome the first hurdle, and have nevertheless decided to develop a customized version of the software, later realize an even more serious problem. Every update of the standard program to the subsequent versions, in fact, involves considerable charges for the transfer of customizations to the new version. This is because it is almost never applicable tout court to the customized version and therefore, in order to carry out the realignment, other development activities are necessary, with further waiting times and, above all, a substantial increase in costs to be sustained.  The alternative, which many end up adopting, is to remain anchored to the version of the program on which the customization has been developed, renouncing to subsequent updates, but this way of operating is not sustainable indefinitely.  Beyond the problems of security, efficiency and reliability of the system that this short-sighted strategy entails, sooner or later, either because of the release of new operating systems, or because of legal obligations, it will still be necessary to update and incur in one go all the costs necessary to realign the customized software to the latest standard version.  With X-Cross, you no longer have to worry about the time and cost of customizing and updating your ERP. CrossModel, the development tool X-Cross was created with, solves all customization issues at the root.  Thanks to it, X-Cross can, at any time, be updated to the latest version without any cost for the transfer of the changes made, which are automatically transferred to the standard version without any manual intervention.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/erp/x-cross-profile,3.0

Our History - NEXUSsoft is an Australian owned company located in Brisbane that has been in business since 2003. We started as a single person in our own multifaceted business designing software that met our unique requirements.   The operations of our business spanned entertainment, hospitality, events, and retail sectors.   We gained our first external customer in 2008, that being an IT and telecommunications managed service provider. Our next being a printing company. We gained our next customer in 2011 that operated in the medico-legal assessments industry.   In each case, these businesses had requirements that meant that a templated ERP  system was not going to meet their requirements. Some of them had tried using off the shelf systems and some had not. Some had spent considerable amounts of money implementing ERP systems that were eventually discarded.   From the outset we have been not just a team of software developers, but a team of people determined to make software fit the requirements of a business and not the other way around.   We know that there are innovative businesses being held back by bad systems, manual processes, errors, and rework. We also know that when we find these businesses, we can help them grow, change, adapt and succeed.   We know that we are not for everyone.   We know why ERP deployments suceed and fail, and we have been working with innovative Australian businesses for more than 20 years.",https://www.softwareadvice.com/erp/icerp-by-nexussoft-profile,5.0
